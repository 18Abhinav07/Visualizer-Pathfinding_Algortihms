# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is a pathfinding visualizer that allows users to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action. It provides an interactive interface where users can create obstacles, and watch as the algorithm finds the shortest path between them.

## Packages Needed

To run this project, you will need the following packages:

❯ npm create vite@latest pathfinding-visualizer -- --template react-ts
❯ npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
❯ npx tailwindcss init -p
❯ npm i
❯ npm install react-icons
❯ npm run dev

```

## Characteristics

This pathfinding visualizer has the following characteristics:

- Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the visualizer by creating obstacles, setting start and end points, and watching the algorithm in action.
- Multiple Algorithms: The visualizer supports various pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, and Breadth-First Search.
- Visualization: The visualizer provides a graphical representation of the algorithm's progress, allowing users to see how the path is being explored.
- Customization: Users can customize the animation speed and algorithms, and other parameters to suit their preferences.
